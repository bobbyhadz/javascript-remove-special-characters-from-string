## Instructions

The JS code is in the `index.js` file.

To be able to run the code, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub repository with the `git clone` command.
2. Open your terminal in the project's root directory (right next
   to `package.json`).
3. Install the node modules.

```bash:shell
npm install
```

4. To run the code, issue the `npm start` command.

```bash:shell
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can run the project in watch mode, so every
time you save, the JavaScript server is restarted.

```bash:shell
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command uses `nodemon` to watch for changes and
restarts your JavaScript project every time you save (Ctrl + S).
